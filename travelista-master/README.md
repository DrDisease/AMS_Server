This is an implementation of the Pickl-a-Guide project concept.
The Pick-a-guide concept is a project idea, whose main concept is making a mobile/web app that allows its users to book tours in famous cities, places and every other kind of tourism that requires a guide.

The Web App is implemented on a WAMP stack (Windows,Apache,MySQL and PHP) and in order to get this running on localhost, WAMP should be installed as described in the WAMP official website: http://www.wampserver.com/en/ .
This who√ße project should be put inside the www folder in the WAMP installation directory, and after such, the WAMP service must be initialised.
